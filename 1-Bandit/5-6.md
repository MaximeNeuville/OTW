## Resolution

We go trought `inhere/` and list file

```console
bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere ; ls
maybehere00  maybehere03  maybehere06  maybehere09  maybehere12  maybehere15  maybehere18
maybehere01  maybehere04  maybehere07  maybehere10  maybehere13  maybehere16  maybehere19
maybehere02  maybehere05  maybehere08  maybehere11  maybehere14  maybehere17
```

Open the first directory :

```console
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cd maybehere00 ; ls
-file1  -file2  -file3  spaces file1  spaces file2  spaces file3
```

As you can see they are several file in these directories.
So go back to `inhere` and use `find` to find the file corresponding to:

    * human-readable
    * 1033 bytes in size
    * not executable

We gonna used `find` argument:

    * -type : file type
    * -size : size of the file
    * ! -executable : for non-executable file

Find command :

```console
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -type f -size 1033c -name "[[:print:]]*" ! -executable
./maybehere07/.file2
```

Password for next level :

```console
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cat maybehere07/.file2
